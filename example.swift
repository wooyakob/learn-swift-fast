// ContentView - views are how SwiftUI represents our app's user interface, we can add custom layout and logic here.

// Updating default body code in ContentView with:
var body: some View {
    Text("Hello, SwiftUI!")
}

// This is a computed property called body, 
// and SwiftUI will call that 
// whenever it wants to display our user interface
